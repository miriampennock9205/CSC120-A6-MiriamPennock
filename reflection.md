- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I've used inhertiance previously, and my main impression from that experience and this assignment is that it simplifies code organization and improves readability, which who doesn't want that. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I had good success in general using inheritance to create subclasses and implement specific methods. I didn't come across any major issues, although it did take me a while to test everything. As for future students, I would recommend writting Javadoc comments as you code because I decided to do them at the end this time and it felt very tedious.
